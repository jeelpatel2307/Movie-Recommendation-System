# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project provides a simple Movie Recommendation System using Python with Flask on the server-side and HTML on the client side. It suggests movies based on user preferences using a basic recommendation algorithm.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on the selected movie's genre.
- Provides a dropdown list to choose movies for recommendations.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    ```bash
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    
    ```
    
3. **Install Dependencies:**
    
    ```bash
    pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn
    
    ```
    
4. **Run the Server:**
    
    ```bash
    python app.py
    
    ```
    
5. **Open the Application:**
    - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
6. **Get Movie Recommendations:**
    - Select a movie from the dropdown list and click "Get Recommendations" to see suggested movies.

## Customization

- Replace the sample movie data in `app.py` with your own dataset.
- Enhance the recommendation algorithm, considering more advanced techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
- Improve the UI and styling for a better user experience.
- Integrate with a larger movie database or an external movie API for a diverse and accurate movie selection.

## Important Note

- This project uses a basic recommendation algorithm for educational purposes. Consider using more advanced techniques for a production-level movie recommendation system.
